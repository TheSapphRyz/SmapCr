# S-maps
## What is this?
A small initial map editor project for my game and future **game engine**. Supports both orthogonal and isometric editing of isometric maps.

## What's next?

- add callback functions as object parameters (for **game engine**)
- Implementation of a game engine to make games with minimal code
